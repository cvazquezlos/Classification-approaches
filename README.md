# Classification approaches
This repository is organized as follows:

1. Each directory is a classification approach developed in Python 3.6.
2. The approach is ready to use as you download it. For convolutional neural networks you should first download the .rar files, merge them and then save them into the selected directory.
3. Each week (or 10 days) a new approach will be updated. The classifiers will be developed in R in a nearly future.
4. Enjoy!
